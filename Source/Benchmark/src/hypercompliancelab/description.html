<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Compliance checking is the operation that consists of assessing whether every
execution trace of a business process satisfies a given correctness condition.
The paper introduces the notion of hyperquery, which is a calculation that
involves multiple traces from a log at the same time. A particular case of
hyperquery is a hypercompliance condition, which is a correctness requirement
that involves the whole log instead of individual process instances.</p>

<p>This lab proposes a benchmark for an extension of the
<a href="https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3">BeepBeep 3</a> event stream
engine designed to evaluate hyperqueries on event logs. It evaluates various
hyperqueries on event logs that are either synthetic, or retrieved from
real-world online log repositories. Among the elements that are measured are
the total and progressive running time to evaluate a query, as well as the
amount of memory consumed.</p>

<h3>How to use this benchmark</h3>
